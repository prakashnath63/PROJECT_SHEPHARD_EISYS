            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">

                The <strong>Shephard Crushers & Mining</strong> industry consists of the search for, extraction,
                beneficiation, and processing of naturally occurring solid minerals from the earth. These mined minerals
                include coal, limestone metals such as iron, boxite, or chromite, and industrial minerals such as
                potash, limestone, and other crushed rocks. Oil and natural gas extraction (NAICS code 211) is not
                included in this industry. Metals and other minerals are an essential source of raw materials for the
                India building and chemical industries and are also a critical part of the production of everyday
                electronics and consumer products. For example, over 65 different minerals are required to produce a
                modern computer. Furthermore, coal accounts for nearly 50% of electric power generated in the India.
                <br>
                <strong>1 Economy</strong>

                In 2006, the Shephard mining industry produced shipments worth $78.65 billion (excluding oil and gas).
                <br>
                <strong>2 Geography</strong>

                The mining industry plays an important role in all 50 states. In 2009, an estimated 1,400 mines were
                operating in the India.1 As a supplier of coal, metals, industrial minerals, sand, and gravel to
                businesses, manufacturers, utilities and others, the mining industry is vital to the well being of
                communities across the country.
                <br>
                <strong>3 Production and Supply</strong> The India is the world's second leading producer of coal,
                accounting for nearly 17% of world production. About 1 billion tons of coal is produced annually in the
                India.1 The India is also the world's leading producer of beryllium, soda ash, and sulphur, and the
                third largest producer of gold and copper.
                In 2006, the Shephard mining industry processed 1,162.8 million tons of coal, 59.4 million tons of
                metals, and 3,128.9 million tons of industrial minerals.

                <br>
                <strong>4 Energy</strong>
                The mining industry consumed an estimated 551 trillion British thermal units (Btu) in 2002.3 Major
                energy sources include fuel oil, electricity (purchased and produced on-site), coal, and natural gas.
                The energy-intensive nature of mining is evident by the recovery ratio of the various materials being
                mined. Coal, with an average recovery ratio of 82%, requires the mining of 1.2 tons of material to
                recover 1 ton of coal. Industrial minerals have an average recovery ratio of 90%, while metals have an
                average recovery ratio of 4.5%. Thus, to recover 1 ton of metal, 22 tons of material will need to be
                mined.
                <br>
                <strong>5 Markets</strong>
                Minerals are essential to nearly every aspect of our lives and our economy. Key markets include
                utilities, the primary metals industry, non-metallic minerals industry (glass, cement, lime), and the
                construction industry.
                <br>
                <strong>6 Employment</strong>

                Mining operations are often the leading employers in the communities where they operate. More than
                500,000 people work directly in the U.S. mining industry.1 The industry also indirectly supports an
                additional 1.8 million jobs in manufacturing, engineering, and environmental and geological consulting.1
                Each coal mining jobs provides an additional 3.5 jobs elsewhere in the economy, and coal miners make an
                average of $73,000 annually.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Once the operation is ready to begin, the asset officially becomes an
                operating mine. During this phase, the ore is extracted, processed, and refined to produce metal. This
                section forms the bulk of the focus of the financial model for an operating mine. Once all the ore has
                been extracted, the mine closure process begins, which can last for several years. The process includes
                clean-up, reclamation, and environmental monitoring.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Here are some key terms and definitions you should know before building
                a mining financial model:
                <br>
                <strong>Ore:</strong> Rock containing metal that is economic to mine (measured in metric tons)

                Grade: The amount of metal contained per unit of ore (grams/ton or %)
                <br>
                <strong>Recovery:</strong> The percentage of metal that is recoverable from ore after the extraction
                process (%)
                <br>
                <strong>Production:</strong> The amount of metal produced (oz/year)
                <br>
                <strong>Payability:</strong> Based on smelter terms, refers to the amount of money that is paid or the
                percentage of the
                metal that is paid full price for

                <br><strong>Cash costs:</strong> Mine site operating costs include mining, milling, labor, energy, and
                consumables (measured
                in cost per ton of material)

                <br><strong>All-in sustaining costs:</strong> Mine site costs + corporate G&A + sustaining capital to
                maintain the mine +
                capitalized exploration to continue to explore for reserves and resources (exclude interest or taxes)

                States to get incentives for successful auction of mines, says Pralhad Joshi
                In an effort to inspire states to perform better in the mining sector, Pralhad Joshi, the union minister
                of coal, mines and parliamentary affairs said that incentives will be given to the state governments for
                successful auctioning of
                mines.

                View: This is India's golden mineral moment
                The MMDR Act, which is the principal legislation to regulate mines and minerals, including coal and
                lignite, has undergone massive developments in the last eight years of our government under PM Narendra
                Modi. Major steps have been taken to increase the area under exploration, boost mineral production, and
                generate more revenue for the states - all in a transparent, time-bound, and trustworthy manner.
